## Motivation

I would like to make some useful small programs. It is my hobby. These programs will live on the web. Why code anything else today?

Without exception, sooner or later every program needs a database. I think Postgres is a great open source database. This is the main point of my programs: get some data from the user, transform it somehow and return it to the user in a different form. 90% of that is going to work inside the database. It is not great for scalability, but that is not a problem I will ever encounter.

The client cannot be connected directly to the database. That is a no-no. We need a web server with some middleware. I choose the Rust language and one of its library crates Axum.

The only client I need is a browser. All browsers work with HTML5, CSS3 and WebAssembly/WASM. There exists PWA/progressive web applications, electron or Tauri to make the web app feel like a native one. I think it is a good trick to make the client truly cross-platform.

This three-tier architecture has great potential. I don't see the point to make it less flexible than that.

## Naming

Naming things is the major difficulty of programming. There is seldom a good name around. Usually when you choose one, you have to stick with it forever.

I choose the strange name **"liporuwcha"** for this project. It is an abbreviation of the Stack Linux-Postgres-Rust-WASM-CSS3-HTML5-Axum. This will be the name of my "framework". On top of this framework it will be relatively easy to add functionality or different apps.
